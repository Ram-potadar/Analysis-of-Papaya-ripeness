# Papaya Ripeness Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and OpenCV to detect papayas in a video and calculate their ripeness percentage based on color analysis in HSV space.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Detects papayas using a YOLOv8 object detection model.
- Allows you to capture a frame manually by pressing the **Enter** key.
- Calculates the ripeness of the detected papaya using HSV color thresholds.
- Displays the ripeness percentage over the fruit.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```

### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```bash
project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ your_script.py
â”œâ”€â”€ runs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ detect/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ train/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ weights/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ best.pt   # Your trained YOLOv8 model
â””â”€â”€ papaya_video2.mp4         # Input video file
```

### ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Place your custom-trained best.pt file in the path: ./runs/detect/train/weights/.
2. Ensure the input video path (papaya_video2.mp4) is valid.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python your_script.py
```
4. While the video is playing:
     - Press Enter to capture a frame.
     - The YOLO model will detect the papaya, crop it, and analyze its ripeness.
     - Press Esc to exit.

### ðŸ–¼ Output
- Displays the current video frame.
- Shows the detected fruit region with a bounding box.
- Overlays the ripeness percentage.
